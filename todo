# TODO
- add eg ~/j convenience symlinks to home dir
- add random executables like gitch to my nixos path
- activate experimental features temporarily to bootstrap the first run of nixos-setup
- how to auto-config external displays & mouse speed from nix config?
- hook nvim '+' register into system clipboard

# NixOS Init
- boot into fresh NixOS installation
- connect to wifi
- copy ~/.secret from external drive (just need ssh key really)
- git clone etc (public source would make this easier & prev step could be removed)
- run `bash etc/bin/nixos-setup`
