# TODO
- add random executables like gitch to my nixos path
- how to auto-config external displays & mouse speed from nix config?

# NixOS Init
- boot into fresh NixOS installation
- connect to wifi
- nix-shell -p git
- copy ~/.secret from external drive (just need ssh key really)
- git clone etc (public source would make this easier & prev step could be removed)
- run `bash etc/bin/nixos-setup`
